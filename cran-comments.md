## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to optimize MLwrap 0.2.0.

In this new version 0.2.1.:

Minor adjustments were made to ensure compatibility with the jamovi framework.
These changes allow the package to be used for building a jamovi module that
accesses MLwrap functionalities through the jamovi interface. The updates
improve function exposure, interface binding, and module compilation within
the jamovi environment.

R CMD check results

Local (Windows 11, R 4.5.0): 0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes,

Optional pretests:

Debian GCC (R-hub) clean, with the expected clock NOTE only.

Additional comments

Thank you for reviewing this resubmission to optimize MLwrap.
